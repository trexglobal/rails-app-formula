# example logrotate config file, I usually keep this in
# /etc/logrotate.d/unicorn_app on my Debian systems
#
# See the logrotate(8) manpage for more information:
#    http://linux.die.net/man/8/logrotate

# Modify the following glob to match the logfiles your app writes to:
/srv/shared/log/*.log {
    # this first block is mostly just personal preference, though
    # I wish logrotate offered an "hourly" option...
    daily

    rotate 30
    compress
    dateext

    # this is important if using "compress" since we need to call
    # the "lastaction" script below before compressing:
    delaycompress

    # note the lack of the evil "copytruncate" option in this
    # config.  Unicorn supports the USR1 signal and we send it
    # as our "lastaction" action:
    lastaction
        # assuming your pid file is in /srv/shared/tmp/unicorn.pid
        pid=/srv/shared/tmp/unicorn.pid
        test -s $pid && kill -USR1 "$(cat $pid)"
    endscript
